**Street:** $550-$650

[Manufacturer's product page.](http://www.sigsauer.com/CatalogProductList/pistols-p320.aspx)

**Comments:** This is a modular pistol by SIG. In the future caliber and size conversion kits will be available. Extremely short trigger with a clean break and very little overtravel. One of the best on the market (with some saying it's flat-out the best, or at least on par with the VP9 and PPQ). Factory night sights are standard but optional. The compact model is short and thin enough to carry concealed.

**MSRP:** $675-$769

**Street:** $550-$700

[Manufacturer's product page.](http://www.lionheartindustries.com/)

**Comments:** A modern take on an Korean service pistol, these are very high-quality alloy-framed compact and subcompact 9mms. They have a unique trigger that can be carried DA, SA, or cocked with the hammer down and the trigger in the DA position. In this third mode the trigger pull has an SA pull weight with a DA pull length. Can be carried safety on or off in all modes. Very durable with a Cerakote finish. All can be carried concealed, obviously the subcompact is better suited for concealed-carry. Optional Novak sights, the larger compact model is offered with or without a railed frame.

The Gen 4 pistols have an improved recoil spring and a reversible magazine release for the southpaw shooters. The Glock 22 can be coverted from .40S&W to .357SIG simply by changing the barrel. Not ideal for conceal carry but works well for both OC and HD

**Size:** Full

**Price:** $550 - $750 (does not include tactical model)

**Comments:** Decocker, adjustable back-straps, fully ambidextrous, surprisingly light for it's size(my FNX45 fully loaded weighs about the same as my Colt 1911 when loaded, and with twice the capacity). it's an FN, what more is there to say?

**Type:** Semiautomatic

**Action:** Striker

**Capacity:** 13+1 double stack

**Size:** Full

**Price:** Gen. 3: $550 Gen. 4: $585

**Comments:** Glock's full sized .45ACP pistol. A large, thick pistol that is more difficult to conceal than its more compact cousins, but benefits from a longer barrel and greater capacity than Glock's compact .45ACP offerings. Most useful as a duty pistol or a HD pistol, particularly after changing out the factory sights for one of the many aftermarket options out there.

**Type:** Semiautomatic

**Action:** DA/SA

**Capacity:** 15+1 double stack, 10+1 in non-free states

**Size:** Compact

**Price:** $850-$1000

**Comments:** Alloy frame, no manual safety, night sights standard, 3 magazines in box. This is a fantastic firearm for someone looking at a DA/SA pistol that works well at the range but isn't so big you can't carry it, as long as you have a bit of cash to throw at it. Far from the cheapest option, but you're getting what you pay for. When I was breaking it in, I put 500 rounds downrange in a day and it was a surprise when I ran out of ammo; it's a pleasure to shoot. The short reset trigger is great too, in SA mode it's on par with a good 1911 trigger. http://www.sigsauer.com/CatalogProductList/pistols-m11-a1.aspx

**Type:** Revolver

**Action:** DAO

**Capacity:** 5

**Size:** Subcompact

**MSRP:** $513 Can be found for around $400

**Comments:** WARNING: Taurus. Hammer is completely enclosed. Extremely small pocket gun.  Small size gives noticeable recoil with .38 rounds and very sharp recoil with .357 magnum rounds.  Few accessories but Crimson Trace Lasergrips are available.  Taurus firearms can be spotty in their quality control.  If you get a good firearm it is typically very reliable but if you get a lemon it is likely its problems will never be fixed properly.
